# JavaSockets
Client/Server Program written in Java to establish a socket network connection

This Program was created to establish a socket connection to my UNF Server address on a misc port to report network performance statistics on my client computer, which is a linux laptop, and the server computer, which is a Linux server. The program was designed to create a new thread for each subsequent connection, to track the impact of the load of n number of connections. The client interface is a text based menu with different unix based command options, and the time to complete the task is measured by tracking by recording when the process is requested and recording when the process is completed. The time to complete is calculated by subtracting the two.
